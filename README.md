# Veritas-2D
Just a test of might of C language. No GL used. Soon this will be Veritas 3D Game engine. Based on olcConsoleGameEngine by JavidX9

# Usage and launch
To launch the example all it needs is VS2015. Compile with x64 settings and launch. WARNING: in project options compile language must be set to C

# Maze3D: 
To launch the game directly, without VS, just go x64, there is console app 5, which is an exe file.

# Current Features:
-Drawing to screen a colored unicode charachter. 
-Creating console window and buffer (resizing does bad things)
-Maze algorithm made in vectors
-Full 3D game of maze
