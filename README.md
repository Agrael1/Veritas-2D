# Veritas Engine
Once it was a test of C language and a platform to learn C++, but now it became a big project, which has proper graphics system, useful C libraries and a Physics Engine.

# Usage and launch
To launch the example all it needs is VS2015 and higher. Compile with x64 settings and launch. WARNING: in project options compile language must be set to C (/TC)

# Maze3D: 
To launch the game directly, without VS, just go x64, there is ConsoleApplication5.exe which runs old Wolfenstein style game .

# Current Features:
-Full Graphical interface and pipeline, capable of loading complex models from almost any 3D file format. 
-Maze algorithm made in vectors
-Full 3D game of maze
-Classes and OOP paradigms!
-Custom C implemented DirectXMath library under the name of Veritas Math
-STL Data structures from C++ with custom allocators
-Exception Handling
